BitMessage Contact
=================================================================

#What
This is a simple template for inserting a "contact me" form into a website that utilizes bitmessage instead of email

#Depends
For this to work you must be running a webserver that can handle PHP and bitmessage as a daemon. I tested this on both Apache2-standalone and Nginx proxypassing to Apache2. If you get errors make sure that "exec" is not disabled in your php.ini
